# DevOps Essentials Mini Projects 

After a round of classes, it is time to get our hands dirty and test our knowledge of the technologies we have been exposed to.

If you are not assigned to a specific project, feel free to take on any one or as many as you want.  We have 10 days to complete the work.

Every work that requires coding should be checked into a repo!

There will be a tech-talk sessions every Wednesdays and Saturdays to meet with the instructor for direction. Please endeavour to try things out yourself, to avail you the opportunity to learn and research.

Thanks
